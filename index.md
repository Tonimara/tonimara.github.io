Woody Allan seid:
> In my next life I want to live my life backwards. You start out dead and get that out of the way.
> Then you wake up in an old people's home feeling better every day. You get kicked out for being too healthy,
> go collect your pension, and then when you start work, you get a gold watch and a party on your first day.
> You work for 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy  your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are
> generally promiscuous, then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a
> kid, you play. You have no responsibilities, you become a baby until you are born. And then you spend your
> last 9 months floating in luxurious spa-like conditions with central heating and room service on tap, larger
> quarters every day and then Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!
